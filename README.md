# Find-a-Grind

### Overview

Find-a-Grind is an application designed to allow a user to input his/her current location and retrieve the names and addresses of 10 nearby coffee shops.

The experience is very simple: enter your location in the search bar, in the form of either a zip code or a city and/or state. Ten results will pop up, each containing a name and address, and the name will be a link to a Google Maps rendering of the location of the coffee shop.
